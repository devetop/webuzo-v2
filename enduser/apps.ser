You install it in front of any server that speaks HTTP and configure it to cache the contents. Varnish Cache is really, really fast. It typically speeds up delivery with a factor of 300 - 1000x, depending on your architecture. A high level overview of what Varnish does can be seen in the video attached to this web page.";s:8:"features";s:2833:"<h2 >Design</h2>
			<p>
			One of the main features of Varnish is its design. Varnish is a modern program, designed and written for modern operating systems. To read more about the thoughts that lie behind the design see the architect notes.
			</p>
			<h2 >VCL</h2>
			<p>
			Another main feature of Varnish is its configuration language. VCL is a domain specific language. Varnish compiles the configuration into binary code and runs it. VCL can be loaded and replaced on the fly. 
			</p>
			<p>
			All this adds a lot of speed and flexibility. To read more about the VCL start out with the main VCL page and the VCL examples.
			</p>
			<h3 >A sub-feature of VCL - inline C</h3>
			<p>
			Varnish allows you to add C code in your VCL - giving you the option to easily expand Varnish on the fly. 
			</p>
			<h2 >Load balancing and backend health polling</h2>
			<p>
			As it's quite common to use more than one origin server to feed varnish, it has a built in load balancer. This consists of two parts:
			</p>
			<ul><li>The health polling system, which maintains a list of backends able to receive traffic.
			</li><li>The director, which directs the request to the right backend.
			</li></ul>
			<h2 >Edge Side Includes - ESI</h2>
			<p>
			ESI allows you to split up your web page into components cache them individually. If you're going to use Varnish to accelerate a dynamic
			web site with a lot of personalized content ESI is the key to success, more or less. 
			</p>
			<h2 >Graceful handling of dead and slow backends</h2>
			<p>
			Varnish can serve old content while the origin server generates new content. Work is underway to ensure that Varnish can also keep serving content if the origin server is crashed. 
			</p>
			<h2 >The web management administration interface</h2>
			<p>
			If you're managing a whole cluster of varnish servers you might find the Varnish Administration Console useful. It is only available for customers with a Varnish Enterprise Subscription.
			</p>
			<h2>The management port</h2>
			<p>
			A running Varnish cache can be managed with a management port. You can just telnet in and upload a new configuration, change settings, etc. .
			</p>
			<h2 >Rewriting and redirecting URLs</h2>
			<p>
			Varnish can both rewrite and redirect URLs without any external programs. 
			</p>
			<h2 >Live statistics and logging</h2>
			<p>
			For performance reasons varnish logs to a shared memory segment. Several tools can be used to inspect and analyze the logs. 
			<p>Varnishlog gives you a dump of the raw logs Varnishlog for an explanation of what the tags means.</p> 
			<p>varnishhist	will give you a rather intuitive histogram of what the typical response times are.</p>
			<p>varnishstat will give you a lot of statistics.</p>

				<li>
					<b>Batch and Real-Time full-text indexes.</b> Two index  backends that support both efficient offline index construction andincremental on-the-fly index updates are available.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Non-text attributes support</b>. An arbitrary number of attributes (product IDs, company names, prices, etc) can be stored in the index and used either just for retrieveal (to avoid hitting the DB), or for efficient Sphinx-side search result set post-processing.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>SQL database indexing.</b> Sphinx can directly access and index data stored in MySQL (all storage engines are supported), PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, Drizzle, and anything else that supports ODBC.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Non-SQL storage indexing.</b> Data can also be streamed to batch indexer in a simple XML format called XMLpipe, or inserted directly into an incremental RT index.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Easy application integration.</b> Sphinx comes with three different APIs, SphinxAPI, SphinxSE, and SphinxQL. SphinxAPI is a native library available for Java, PHP, Python, Perl, C, and other languages. SphinxSE, a pluggable storage engine for MySQL, enables huge result sets to be shipped directly to MySQL server for post-processing. SphinxQL lets the application query Sphinx using standard MySQL client libary and query syntax.
					</li>
				<li>
					<b>Advanced full-text searching syntax</b>. Our querying engine supports arbitrarily complex queries combining boolean operators, phrase, proximity, strict order, and quorum matching, field and position limits, exact keyword form matching, substring searches, etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Rich database-like querying features.</b> Sphinx does not limit you to just keyword searching. On top of full-text search result set, you can compute arbitrary arithmetic expressions, add WHERE conditions, do ORDER BY, GROUP BY, use MIN/MAX/AVG/SUM, aggregates etc. Essentially, full-blown SQL SELECT is supported.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Better relevance ranking.</b> Unlike many other engines, Sphinx does not solely rely on 30-year-old statistical ranking that only considers keyword frequencies, nor limits you to it. By default, Sphinx additionally analyzes keyword proximity, and ranks closer phrase matches higher, with perfect matches ranked on top. Also, ranking is flexible: you can choose from a number of built-in relevance functions, tweak their weights by using expressions, or develop new ones.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Flexible text processing.</b> Sphinx indexing features include full support for SBCS and UTF-8 encodings (meaning that effectively all world's languages are supported); stopword removal and optional hit position removal (hitless indexing); morphology and synonym processing through word forms dictionaries and stemmers; exceptions and blended characters; and many more.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Distributed searching.</b> Searches can be distributed across multiple machines, enabling horizontal scale-out and HA (High Availability).

	<p>Hypertable was designed for the express purpose of solving the scalability problem, a problem that is not handled well by a traditional RDBMS.  While it is possible to design a distributed RDBMS system by breaking the dataset into shards, this solution requires an enormous amount of engineering effort and the resulting system will have inherent weaknesses because the core database engine was not designed for scalability.  Hypertable is based on a design developed by Google to meet their scalability requirements and solves the scale problem better than any of the other NoSQL solutions out there.</p>
	<h2>Good Fit For Wide Range of Applications</h2>
	<p>Many of the current scalable NoSQL database offerings are based on a hash table design which means that the data they manage is not kept physically ordered by any meaningful key.  These systems do not lend themselves well to applications that require fast access to ranges of data (e.g. analytics, sorted URL lists, messaging applications, etc).  Because Hypertable keeps data physically sorted by a primary key, it is well-suited to a broad set of applications.</p>
	
	<h2>Cost Savings </h2>
	<p>Hypertable has been designed and implemented for maximum efficiency and optimum performance.  By choosing to do the implementation in a compiled language that does not incur the performance and stability costs of garbage collection and runtime interpretation, Hypertable can deliver equivalent database capacity on a fraction of the hardware.  This translates into less equipment, less power consumption, and less datacenter real estate.</p>
	
	<h2>Performance</h2>
	<p>The other benefit of Hypertable's highly efficient design and implementation is that it delivers all the advantages you get from better performance.  For live applications, Hypertable can help deliver a much more responsive user experience by reducing overall request latency.  For offline applications, higher throughput is achieved which means more work can be accomplished in a given amount of time.</p>
	
	<h2>Clean Semantics</h2>	
	<p> Hypertable is a consistent database.  Many of the scalable NoSQL database offerings are designed around the concept of eventual consistency which makes those databases more difficult to reason about.  Eventually consistent databases require complex syntactic or semantic reconcilers and in some circumstances can even lose data.  When an application writes data into Hypertable and gets a success response, the modification is durable and will always be reflected in subsequent operations.

		<br /><br />
		Dovecot is an excellent choice for both small and large installations. It's fast, simple to set up, requires no special administration and it uses very little memory.";s:8:"features";s:3680:"<p>Some of the most notable features of Dovecot include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dovecot is among the <strong>highest performing</strong> IMAP servers
   while still supporting the <strong>standard</strong>
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/MailboxFormat/mbox">mbox</a> and
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/MailboxFormat/Maildir">Maildir</a>
   formats. The mailboxes are transparently indexed, which gives Dovecot its
   good performance while still providing full compatibility with existing
   mailbox handling tools.</li>

  <li>Dovecot is <strong>standards compliant</strong>. Dovecot v1.1 passes
   all <a href="http://imapwiki.org/ImapTest/ServerStatus">IMAP server
   standard compliancy tests</a> while most other servers fail many of
   them.</li>

  <li>Dovecot's indexes are <strong>self-optimizing</strong>. They contain
   exactly what the user's client commonly needs, no more and no less.</li>

  <li>Dovecot is <strong>self-healing</strong>. It tries to fix most of the
   problems it notices by itself, such as broken index files. The problems are
   however logged so the administrator can later try to figure out what caused
   them.</li>

  <li>Dovecot tries to be <strong>admin-friendly</strong>. Common error
   messages are made as easily understandable as possible. Any crash, no
   matter how it happened, is considered a bug that will be fixed.</li>

  <li>Dovecot allows mailboxes and their indexes to be modified by multiple
   computers at the same time, while still performing well. This means that
   Dovecot <strong>works well with clustered filesystems</strong>.
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/NFS">NFS has caching problems</a>,
   but you can work around them with <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Director">
   director proxies</a>.</li>

  <li>Dovecot's user authentication is extremely flexible and feature-rich,
   supporting many different
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Authentication">authentication
   databases</a> and
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Authentication/Mechanisms">mechanisms.</a>
   </li>

  <li><a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a> 2.3+ and
   <a href="http://www.exim.org/">Exim</a> 4.64+ users can do SMTP
   authentication directly against Dovecot's authentication backend without
   having to configure it separately.</li>

  <li>Dovecot supports easy
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Migration">migration from many existing
   IMAP and POP3 servers</a>, allowing the change to be transparent to
   existing users.</li>

  <li>Dovecot supports <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Clients">workarounds</a>
   for several bugs in IMAP and POP3 clients. Since the workarounds may cause
   the protocol exchange to be slightly less optimal, you can enable only the
   workarounds you need.</li>

  <li>Dovecot's <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Design/Processes">design</a>
   and <a href="/doc/securecoding.txt">implementation</a> is highly focused on
   security. Rather than taking the traditional road of just fixing
   vulnerabilities whenever someone happens to report them,
   <a href="security.html">I offer 1000 EUR</a> of my own money to the first
   person to find a security hole from Dovecot.</li>

  <li>Dovecot is easily extensible.
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Plugins">Plugins</a> can add new commands,
   modify existing behavior, add their own data into index files or even add
   support for new mailbox formats. For example
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Quota">quota</a> and
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/ACL">ACL support</a> are completely
   implemented as plugins.</li>

                <li><p>In addition to the benefits of parsing logs in a single stream, BFD also uses a log tracking system so logs are only parsed from the point which they were last read. This greatly assists in extending the performance of BFD even further as we are not constantly reading the same log data. The log tracking system is
compatible with syslog/logrotate style log rotations which allows it to detect when rotations have happened and grab log tails from both the new log file and the rotated log file.</p></li>
                <li><p>You can also leverage BFD to block attackers using any number of tools such as APF, Shorewall, raw iptables, ip route or execute any custom command.

			  memcached allows you to take memory from parts of your system where
			  you have more than you need and make it accessible to areas where
			  you have less than you need.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  memcached also allows you to make better use of your memory.  If you
			  consider the diagram to the right, you can see two deployment
			  scenarios:
			</p>
			
			<ol>
			  <li>Each node is completely independent (top).</li>
			  <li>Each node can make use of memory from other nodes (bottom).</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>
			  The first scenario illustrates the classic deployment strategy,
			  however you'll find that it's both wasteful in the sense that the
			  total cache size is a fraction of the actual capacity of your web
			  farm, but also in the amount of effort required to keep the
			  cache consistent across all of those nodes.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  With memcached, you can see that all of the servers are looking into
			  the same virtual pool of memory.  This means that a given item is
			  always stored and always retrieved from the same location in your
			  entire web cluster.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  Also, as the demand for your application grows
			  to the point where you need to have more servers, it generally also
			  grows in terms of the data that must be regularly accessed.  A
			  deployment strategy where these two aspects of your system scale
			  together just makes sense.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  The illustration to the right only shows two web servers for
			  simplicity, but the property remains the same as the number
			  increases.  If you had fifty web servers, you'd still have a usable
			  cache size of 64MB in the first example, but in the second, you'd
			  have 3.2GB of usable cache.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  Of course, you aren't required to use your web server's memory for
			  cache.  Many memcached users have dedicated machines that are built
			  to only be memcached servers.

			<p>Understanding the MVC pattern is key to understanding Rails. MVC divides your application into three layers, each with a specific responsibility.</p>

			<p>The View layer is composed of "templates" that are responsible for providing appropriate representations of your application's resources. Templates can come in a variety of formats, but most view templates are HTML with embedded Ruby code (ERB files).</p>

			<p>The Model layer represents your domain model (such as Account, Product, Person, Post, etc.) and encapsulates the business logic that is specific to your application. In Rails, database-backed model classes are derived from ActiveRecord::Base. Active Record allows you to present the data from database rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic methods. Although most Rails models are backed by a database, models can also be ordinary Ruby classes, or Ruby classes that implement a set of interfaces as provided by the Active Model module. You can read more about Active Record in its README.</p>

			<p>The Controller layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and providing a suitable response. Usually this means returning HTML, but Rails controllers can also generate XML, JSON, PDFs, mobile-specific views, and more. Controllers manipulate models and render view templates in order to generate the appropriate HTTP response.</p>

			<p>In Rails, the Controller and View layers are handled together by Action Pack. These two layers are bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is unlike the relationship between Active Record and Action Pack, which are independent. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of Rails.</p>";s:5:"space";s:8:"97111344";s:7:"support";s:23:"http://rubyonrails.org/";s:7:"version";s:5:"5.2.0";s:8:"category";s:21:"server_side_scripting";s:7:"ratings";s:5:"5.000";s:5:"votes";s:1:"4";s:7:"reviews";s:1:"0";s:4:"logo";s:8:"logo.gif";s:11:"description";s:201:"Ruby on Rails is a breakthrough in lowering the barriers of entry to programming.Powerful web applications that formerly might have taken weeks or months to develop can be produced in a matter of days.";s:4:"desc";s:81:"Ruby on Rails is a breakthrough in lowering the barriers of entry to programming.";s:8:"approved";s:1:"1";s:3:"ins";s:1:"0";s:6:"parent";s:0:"";s:4:"file";s:0:"";s:6:"file64";s:16:"rails-x86_64.zip";s:5:"major";s:1:"0";s:3:"mod";s:1:"5";s:9:"mod_files";s:1:"1";s:12:"release_date";s:10:"09-04-2018";s:3:"md5";s:0:"";s:7:"urlname";s:5:"Rails";}i:92;a:30:{s:3:"aid";s:2:"92";s:4:"name";s:17:"Varnish Extension";s:8:"softname";s:11:"mod_varnish";s:8:"fullname";s:17:"Varnish Extension";s:4:"type";s:3:"app";s:10:"group_type";N;s:14:"webuzo_version";s:0:"";s:8:"overview";s:78:"Varnish Cache is an open source, state of the art web application accelerator.";s:8:"features";s:111:"The extension makes it possible to interact with a running varnish instance through TCP socket or shared memory";s:5:"space";s:5:"11468";s:7:"support";s:35:"http://pecl.php.net/package/varnish";s:7:"version";s:5:"1.1.1";s:8:"category";s:7:"modules";s:7:"ratings";s:5:"5.000";s:5:"votes";s:1:"4";s:7:"reviews";s:1:"0";s:4:"logo";s:8:"logo.gif";s:11:"description";s:112:"The extension makes it possible to interact with a running varnish instance through TCP socket or shared memory.";s:4:"desc";s:78:"Varnish Cache is an open source, state of the art web application accelerator.";s:8:"approved";s:1:"1";s:3:"ins";s:1:"0";s:6:"parent";s:0:"";s:4:"file";s:0:"";s:6:"file64";s:22:"mod_varnish-x86_64.zip";s:5:"major";s:1:"0";s:3:"mod";s:1:"2";s:9:"mod_files";s:1:"5";s:12:"release_date";s:10:"20-10-2013";s:3:"md5";s:0:"";s:7:"urlname";s:17:"Varnish_Extension";}i:28;a:30:{s:3:"aid";s:2:"28";s:4:"name";s:6:"libcap";s:8:"softname";s:6:"libcap";s:8:"fullname";s:6:"libcap";s:4:"type";s:7:"library";s:10:"group_type";N;s:14:"webuzo_version";s:0:"";s:8:"overview";N;s:8:"features";N;s:5:"space";s:4:"2392";s:7:"support";s:21:"http://www.kernel.org";s:7:"version";s:4:"2.22";s:8:"category";s:9:"libraries";s:7:"ratings";s:5:"4.500";s:5:"votes";s:1:"4";s:7:"reviews";s:1:"0";s:4:"logo";s:8:"logo.gif";s:11:"description";s:94:"libcap is a library for getting and setting POSIX.1e (formerly POSIX 6) draft 15 capabilities.";s:4:"desc";s:40:"libcap is a FREE and OpenSource Library.";s:8:"approved";s:1:"1";s:3:"ins";s:1:"1";s:6:"parent";s:0:"";s:4:"file";s:0:"";s:6:"file64";s:17:"libcap-x86_64.zip";s:5:"major";s:1:"0";s:3:"mod";s:1:"3";s:9:"mod_files";s:1:"1";s:12:"release_date";s:10:"13-01-2013";s:3:"md5";s:0:"";s:7:"urlname";s:6:"libcap";}i:19;a:30:{s:3:"aid";s:2:"19";s:4:"name";s:4:"PERL";s:8:"softname";s:4:"perl";s:8:"fullname";s:4:"PERL";s:4:"type";s:3:"app";s:10:"group_type";N;s:14:"webuzo_version";s:0:"";s:8:"overview";s:286:"Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over 24 years of development.

				<li>
					<strong>Most CVS features.</strong>
					<p>CVS is a relatively basic version control system.  For the most
					part, Subversion has matched or exceeded CVS's feature set where
					those features continue to apply in Subversion's particular
					design.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Directories are versioned.</strong>
					<p>Subversion versions directories as first-class objects, just
					like files.</p>
				</li>
	
				<li>
					<strong>Copying, deleting, and renaming are versioned.</strong>
					<p>Copying and deleting are versioned operations.  Renaming is
					also a versioned operation, albeit with some <a
					href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=898"
					>quirks</a>.</p> 
				</li>
	
				<li>
					<strong>Free-form versioned metadata ("properties").</strong>
					<p>Subversion allows arbitrary metadata ("properties") to be
					attached to any file or directory.  These properties are key/value
					pairs, and are versioned just like the objects they are attached
					to.  Subversion also provides a way to attach arbitrary key/value
					properties to a revision (that is, to a committed changeset).
					These properties are not versioned, since they attach metadata to
					the version-space itself, but they can be changed at any time.</p>
				</li>
	
				<li>
					<strong>Atomic commits.</strong>
					<p>No part of a commit takes
					effect until the entire commit has succeeded.  Revision numbers
					are per-commit, not per-file, and commit's log message is attached
					to its revision, not stored redundantly in all the files affected
					by that commit.</p> 
				</li>
	
				<li>
					<strong>Branching and tagging are cheap
							(constant time) operations.</strong>
					<p>There is no reason for these operations to be expensive, so
					they aren't.</p>
				
					<p>Branches and tags are both implemented in terms of an
					underlying "copy" operation.  A copy takes up a small, constant
					amount of space.  Any copy is a tag; and if you start committing
					on a copy, then it's a branch as well.  (This does away with CVS's
					"branch-point tagging", by removing the distinction that made
					branch-point tags necessary in the first place.)</p>
				</li>
	
				<li>
					<strong>Merge tracking.</strong>
					<p>Subversion 1.5 introduces merge tracking: automated assistance
					with managing the flow of changes between lines of development,
					and with the merging of branches back into their sources.  The 1.5
					release of merge tracking has basic support for common scenarios;
					we will be extending the feature in upcoming releases.</p>
				</li>
	
				<li>
					<strong>File locking.</strong>
					<p>Subversion supports (but does not require) locking files so that
					users can be warned when multiple people try to edit the same
					file.  A file can be marked as requiring a lock before being
					edited, in which case Subversion will present the file in
					read-only mode until a lock is acquired.</p>
				</li>
	
				<li>
					<strong>Symbolic links can be versioned.</strong>
					<p>Unix users can place symbolic links under version control.  The
					links are recreated in Unix working copies, but not in win32
					working copies.</p>
				</li>
	
				<li>
					<strong>Executable flag is preserved.</strong>
					<p>Subversion notices when a file is executable, and if that file is
					placed into version control, its executability will be preserved
					when it it checked out to other locations.  (The mechanism
					Subversion uses to remember this is simply <a href="#properties"
					>versioned properties</a>, so executability can be manually
					edited when necessary, even from a client that does not
					acknowledge the file's executability, e.g., when having the wrong
					extension under Microsoft Windows).</p>
				</li>
	
	
				<li>
					<strong>Standalone server option (<tt>svnserve</tt>).</strong>
					<p>Subversion offers a standalone server option using a custom
					protocol, since not everyone wants to run an Apache HTTPD server.
					The standalone server can run as an inetd service or in daemon
					mode, and offers the same level of authentication and
					authorization functionality as the HTTPD-based server.  The
					standalone server can also be tunnelled over ssh.</p>

			<p>OrientDB is an Open Source NoSQL DBMS with the features of both Document and Graph DBMSs. Written in Java, it is incredibly fast: it can store up to 150,000 records per second on common hardware. Even for a Document based database, the relationships are managed as in Graph Databases with direct connections among records. You can traverse parts of or entire trees and graphs of records in a few milliseconds. Supports schema-less, schema-full and schema-mixed modes. Has a strong security profiling system based on user and roles and supports SQL amongst the query languages. Thanks to the SQL layer, it’s straightforward to use for those skilled in the relational database world.</p>
			<h2><font color="#e65c08">No More Joins</font></h2>
			<p>OrientDB can embed documents like any other Document Database, but can also connect documents like a Relational Database. The main difference is that OrientDB doesn’t use the costly JOIN, but rather uses direct, super-fast links taken from the Graph Database world.
        No duplicates:  the resulting database is smaller and lighter
        Faster:  a smaller database means better usage of RAM thus allowing more caching
        Upon loading the order document, OrientDB will assemble the entire document by fetching all the connections transparently.</p>
			<h2><font color="#e65c08">Speed</font></h2>
			<p>OrientDB has been designed to be very fast. It inherits the best features and concepts from Document, Graph and Object Databases. Furthermore it uses the own MVRB-Tree algorithm as a mix of Red-Black Tree and B+Tree. MVRB-Tree consumes about half memory of the Red-Black Tree implementation maintaining the original speed while it balances the tree on insertion/update. Furthermore the MVRB-Tree allows fast retrieving and storing of nodes in persistent way.</p>
			<h2><font color="#e65c08">Scalability</font></h2>
			<p>The most common reason applications scale up badly is, very often, the database. The database is the bottleneck of most applications. OrientDB scales up very well on a single machine. A single server does the work of about 125 servers running MySQL. The transactional engine can run in distributed systems supporting up to 302,231,454,903,657 billion (2^78) records for the maximum capacity of 19,807,040,628,566,084 Terabytes of data distributed on multiple disks in multiple nodes.</p>
			<h2><font color="#e65c08">Zero Configuration Clustering</font></h2>
			<p>When you need more throughput, simply add a new server in the network and it will join the current distributed server cluster. Synchronization occurs automatically as soon as the server is brought online. You can’t get it much easier than that!</p>
			<h2><font color="#e65c08">Reliability</font></h2>
			<p>What happens when a server node crashes? The server cluster redistributes the load across the available nodes and all the clients connected to the node in failure are automatically switched to an available server node with no fail-over to the application level.</p>
			<h2><font color="#e65c08">Competitor DBMSs</font></h2>
			<p>OrientDB is a Document-Graph DBMS, so you can compare it against DocumentDB and GraphDB products. If you already know MongoDB, look at OrientDB vs MongoDB page.
Also, take a look at GraphDB comparison and DocumentDB comparison. What about speed? Download the independent Benchmark between GraphDB products “XGDBench: A Benchmarking Platform for Graph Stores in Exascale Clouds“ by Tokyo Institute of Technology and IBM Research.</p>
			<h2><font color="#e65c08">Easy to install and use?</font></h2>
			<p>Absolutely. OrientDB is written completely in Java and can run on any platform without configuration and installation. The Full Server distribution is about 1Mb without the demo database. Do you develop with a language different than Java? No problem, look at the Programming Language Bindings.</p>";s:5:"space";s:8:"36211222";s:7:"support";s:42:"http://www.orientechnologies.com/orientdb/";s:7:"version";s:5:"2.1.0";s:8:"category";s:9:"databases";s:7:"ratings";s:5:"5.000";s:5:"votes";s:1:"3";s:7:"reviews";s:1:"0";s:4:"logo";s:8:"logo.gif";s:11:"description";s:129:"OrientDB is an Open Source NoSQL DBMS with the features of both Document and Graph DBMSs.

				<li>Model based builds: Maven is able to build any number of projects into predefined output types such as a JAR, WAR, or distribution based on metadata about the project, without the need to do any scripting in most cases.</li>
				<li>Coherent site of project information: Using the same metadata as for the build process, Maven is able to generate a web site or PDF including any documentation you care to add, and adds to that standard reports about the state of development of the project. Examples of this information can be seen at the bottom of the left-hand navigation of this site under the &quot;Project Information&quot; and &quot;Project Reports&quot; submenus.</li>
				<li>Release management and distribution publication: Without much additional configuration, Maven will integrate with your source control system such as CVS and manage the release of a project based on a certain tag. It can also publish this to a distribution location for use by other projects. Maven is able to publish individual outputs such as a JAR, an archive including other dependencies and documentation, or as a source distribution.</li>
				<li>Dependency management: Maven encourages the use of a central repository of JARs and other dependencies. Maven comes with a mechanism that your project's clients can use to download any JARs required for building your project from a central JAR repository much like Perl's CPAN. This allows users of Maven to reuse JARs across projects and encourages communication between projects to ensure that backward compatibility issues are dealt with. We are collaborating with the folks at <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.ibiblio.org">Ibiblio</a> who have graciously allowed the central repository to live on their servers.</li>

				<li> <b>Distributed architecture.</b> Traditional version control systems such as Subversion are typical client-server architectures with a central server to store the revisions of a project. In contrast, Mercurial is truly distributed, giving each developer a local copy of the entire development history. This way it works independent of network access or a central server. Committing, branching and merging are fast and cheap.. </li>
				<li> <b>Platform independent.</b> Mercurial was written with platform independence in mind. Therefore most of Mercurial is written in Python, with a small part in portable C for performance reasons. As a result, binary releases are available on all major platforms.</li>
				<li> <b>Fast.</b> Mercurials implementation and data structures are designed to be fast. You can generate diffs between revisions, or jump back in time within seconds. Therefore Mercurial is perfectly suitable for large projects such as OpenJDK (hg) or NetBeans (hg). </li>
				<li> <b>Easy to use.</b>Mercurial sports a consistent command set in which most subversion users feel right at home. Potentially dangerous actions are available via extensions you need to enable, so the basic interface is easy to use, easy to learn and hard to break. The Quick Start should get you going in a just few minutes. </li>

				  RabbitMQ offers a variety of features to let you trade off
				  performance with reliability, including persistence,
				  delivery acknowledgements, publisher confirms, and high
				  availability.
				</p>		
				<h3>Flexible Routing</h3>
				<p>
				  Messages are routed through exchanges before arriving at
				  queues. RabbitMQ features several built-in exchange types
				  for typical routing logic. For more complex routing you
				  can bind exchanges
				  together or even write your own exchange type as a
				  plugin.

				<h3>Clustering</h3>
				<p>
				  Several RabbitMQ servers on a local network can

				<h3>Federation</h3>
				<p>
				  For servers that need to be more loosely and unreliably
				  connected than clustering allows, RabbitMQ offers a
				  federation model.

				<h3>Highly Available Queues</h3>
				<p>
				  Queues can be mirrored across several
				  machines in a cluster, ensuring that even in the event of
				  hardware failure your messages are safe.

PHP allows developers to write extensions in C to add functionality to the PHP language. These can then be compiled into PHP or loaded dynamically at runtime. Extensions have been written to add support for the Windows API, process management on Unix-like operating systems, multibyte strings (Unicode), cURL, and several popular compression formats. Other features include integration with IRC, dynamic generation of images and Adobe Flash content, and even speech synthesis.

				<li><strong>Offline mode</strong>. You can commit changes even if you're on the road with no access to the server. That's because your own working directory is a repository in its own right. When you get home, you do a <code>darcs push</code> to commit to the public server.</li>
				<li><strong>Easy branching and merging</strong>. Every repository is a branch. There is no branch administration except pushing and pulling between repositories.</li>
				<li><strong>Easy patch sending by e-mail</strong>. I want to add a feature or bugfix to an open-source project. I make a local Darcs copy, apply my changes, then send my changes by email (<code>darcs send</code>). The project's maintainer(s) can decide whether to accept or reject the changes. This way, the maintainer(s) of the main repository do not need to give commit privileges to anyone else. This is how Darcs itself is maintained, by the way.</li>
				<li><strong>Parallel development</strong>. Let's say I follow the development of this open-source project, and I have some <code>controversial</code> patches that aren't accepted by the official maintainers. No problem – I make my changes, release my own distribution. It's a fork, of sorts, but it's still connected to the mainline. Whenever the official project makes changes, I do a <code>darcs pull</code> to get them, and resolve any conflicts. This way, my fork is kept up to date with the main project's repository.</li>
				<li><strong>Cherry-picking</strong>. If you've ever worked on a team, you will know that somebody often has a change you want, but which can't be committed to the trunk yet. With Darcs you can grab just the one change by pulling it into your repository.</li>
				<li><strong>Interactivity</strong>. When you record a patch, Darcs enables you to be precise and say "yes" or "no" to every change that you can include in your patch. Thus you can really create minimal patches, or separate your work in several patches, each one doing a consistent change. You can also tell Darcs to record everything in one patch by passing the <code>-a</code> flag to <code>darcs record</code>. Other commands, like <code>darcs pull</code> and <code>darcs push</code>, behave the same.</li>

It is 100% open source, and written in Java. The purpose of Infinispan is to expose a data structure that is distributed, highly concurrent and designed ground-up to make the most of modern multi-processor and multi-core architectures. It is often used as a distributed cache, but also as a NoSQL key/value store or object database.";s:8:"features";s:1251:" <p> Most people use Infinispan for one of two reasons. Firstly, as a distributed cache. Putting Infinispan in front of your database, disk-based NoSQL store or any part of your system that is a bottleneck can greatly help improve performance. Often, a simple cache isn't enough - for example if your application is clustered and cache coherency is important to data consistency. A distributed cache can greatly help here.
			 </p>
			 <p> The other major use-case is as a NoSQL data store. In addition to being in memory, Infinispan can also persist data to a more permanent store. We call this a cache store. Cache stores are pluggable, you can easily write your own, and many already exist for you to use. Learn more about cache stores  and existing implementations you can use today - on the cache stores section of this website. </p>
			 <p> A less common use case is adding clusterability and high availability to frameworks. Since Infinispan exposes a distributed data structure, frameworks and libraries that also need to be clustered can easily achieve this by embedding Infinispan and delegating all state management to Infinispan. This way, any framework can easily be clustered by letting Infinispan do all the heavy lifting.

PHP allows developers to write extensions in C to add functionality to the PHP language. These can then be compiled into PHP or loaded dynamically at runtime. Extensions have been written to add support for the Windows API, process management on Unix-like operating systems, multibyte strings (Unicode), cURL, and several popular compression formats. Other features include integration with IRC, dynamic generation of images and Adobe Flash content, and even speech synthesis.

All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications. 
		<br /><br />
Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable. Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp on them ,which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage. Even when done correctly, different implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the applications are deployed.";s:8:"features";s:2357:"<p>
			   <strong>ZooKeeper is simple.</strong> ZooKeeper
				allows distributed processes to coordinate with each other through a
				shared hierarchal namespace which is organized similarly to a standard
				file system. The name space consists of data registers - called znodes,
				in ZooKeeper parlance - and these are similar to files and directories.
				Unlike a typical file system, which is designed for storage, ZooKeeper
				data is kept in-memory, which means ZooKeeper can achieve high
				throughput and low latency numbers.</p>
				<p>The ZooKeeper implementation puts a premium on high performance,
				highly available, strictly ordered access. The performance aspects of
				ZooKeeper means it can be used in large, distributed systems. The
				reliability aspects keep it from being a single point of failure. The
				strict ordering means that sophisticated synchronization primitives can
				be implemented at the client.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>ZooKeeper is replicated.</strong> Like the
				distributed processes it coordinates, ZooKeeper itself is intended to be
				replicated over a sets of hosts called an ensemble.
			</p>
			<p>
				The servers that make up the ZooKeeper service must all know about
				each other. They maintain an in-memory image of state, along with a
				transaction logs and snapshots in a persistent store. As long as a
				majority of the servers are available, the ZooKeeper service will be
				available.
			</p>
			<p>
				Clients connect to a single ZooKeeper server. The client maintains
				a TCP connection through which it sends requests, gets responses, gets
				watch events, and sends heart beats. If the TCP connection to the server
				breaks, the client will connect to a different server.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>ZooKeeper is ordered.</strong> ZooKeeper
				stamps each update with a number that reflects the order of all
				ZooKeeper transactions. Subsequent operations can use the order to
				implement higher-level abstractions, such as synchronization
				primitives.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>ZooKeeper is fast.</strong> It is
				especially fast in "read-dominant" workloads. ZooKeeper applications run
				on thousands of machines, and it performs best where reads are more
				common than writes, at ratios of around 10:1.

				  In addition to doing distributed version control like Git and Mercurial, Fossil also supports distributed bug tracking, distributed wiki, and a distributed blog mechanism all in a single  integrated package.</li></ol>
			
			<ol><li><b>Web Interface</b> - 
				  Fossil has a built-in and easy-to-use web interface that simplifies project tracking and promotes situational awareness. Simply type "fossil&nbsp;ui" from within any check-out and Fossil automatically opens your web browser in a page that gives detailed graphical history and status information on that project.</li></ol>		
			
			<ol><li><b>Autosync</b> -
				  Fossil supports "autosync" mode which helps to keep projects moving forward by reducing the amount of needless forking and merging often associated with distributed projects.</li></ol>
			
			<ol><li><b>Self-Contained</b> -
				  Fossil is a single stand-alone executable that contains everything needed to do configuration management. Installation is trivial: simply download a   precompiled binary for Linux, Mac, or Windows and put it on your $PATH. Easy-to-compile source code is available for users on other platforms.  Fossil sources are also mostly self-contained, requiring only the standard C library to build.</li></ol>
			
			<ol><li><b>Simple Networking</b> -
				  Fossil uses plain old HTTP (with proxy support) for all network communications, meaning that it works fine from behind restrictive firewalls.  The protocol is
bandwidth efficient to the point that Fossil can be used comfortably over a dial-up internet connection.</li></ol>
			
			<ol><li><b>CGI/SCGI Enabled</b> -
				  No server is required to use fossil. But a server does make collaboration easier. Fossil supports four different yet simple server configurations. The most popular is a 2-line CGI script. This is the approach used by the self-hosting fossil repositories.</li></ol>
			
			<ol><li><b>Robust &amp; Reliable</b> -
				  Fossil stores content using an enduring file format in an SQLite database so that transactions are atomic even if interrupted by a power loss or system crash. Furthermore, automatic self-checks verify that all aspects of the repository are consistent prior to each commit.  In over six years of operation, no work has ever been lost after having been committed to a Fossil repository.</li></ol>";s:5:"space";s:7:"4321472";s:7:"support";s:55:"http://www.fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/tip/www/index.wiki";s:7:"version";s:4:"1.33";s:8:"category";s:15:"version_control";s:7:"ratings";s:5:"0.000";s:5:"votes";s:1:"0";s:7:"reviews";s:1:"0";s:4:"logo";s:8:"logo.gif";s:11:"description";s:79:"Fossil Simple, high-reliability, distributed software configuration management.";s:4:"desc";s:79:"Fossil Simple, high-reliability, distributed software configuration management.";s:8:"approved";s:1:"1";s:3:"ins";s:1:"0";s:6:"parent";s:0:"";s:4:"file";s:0:"";s:6:"file64";s:17:"fossil-x86_64.zip";s:5:"major";s:1:"0";s:3:"mod";s:1:"4";s:9:"mod_files";s:1:"1";s:12:"release_date";s:10:"23-05-2015";s:3:"md5";s:0:"";s:7:"urlname";s:6:"Fossil";}i:86;a:30:{s:3:"aid";s:2:"86";s:4:"name";s:8:"Readline";s:8:"softname";s:8:"readline";s:8:"fullname";s:8:"Readline";s:4:"type";s:7:"library";s:10:"group_type";N;s:14:"webuzo_version";s:0:"";s:8:"overview";s:137:"The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in.";s:8:"features";s:7:"No-Info";s:5:"space";s:7:"6548182";s:7:"support";s:54:"http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.htm";s:7:"version";s:3:"6.3";s:8:"category";s:9:"libraries";s:7:"ratings";s:5:"0.000";s:5:"votes";s:1:"0";s:7:"reviews";s:1:"0";s:4:"logo";s:8:"logo.gif";s:11:"description";s:137:"The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in.";s:4:"desc";s:137:"The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in.";s:8:"approved";s:1:"1";s:3:"ins";s:1:"1";s:6:"parent";s:0:"";s:4:"file";s:0:"";s:6:"file64";s:19:"readline-x86_64.zip";s:5:"major";s:1:"0";s:3:"mod";s:1:"3";s:9:"mod_files";s:1:"1";s:12:"release_date";s:0:"";s:3:"md5";s:0:"";s:7:"urlname";s:8:"Readline";}i:89;a:30:{s:3:"aid";s:2:"89";s:4:"name";s:8:"Libevent";s:8:"softname";s:8:"libevent";s:8:"fullname";s:8:"Libevent";s:4:"type";s:7:"library";s:10:"group_type";N;s:14:"webuzo_version";s:0:"";s:8:"overview";s:236:"The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.

Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.";s:8:"features";s:6515:"<h1>built to kick ass</h1>		  
		  <p>Erlang was developed at <strong>Ericsson</strong> and was designed from the ground up for writing <strong>scalable</strong>, <strong>fault-tolerant</strong>, <strong>distributed</strong>, <strong>non-stop</strong>, <strong>soft-realtime</strong> applications. <em>Everything</em> in the language, runtime and libraries reflects that purpose, which makes Erlang the best platform for developing this kind of software.</p>		  
		  <p>Use Erlang if you want your application to:</p>		  
		  <ul>
			<li>handle very large number of concurrent activities</li>
			<li>be easily distributable over a network of computers</li>
			<li>be fault-tolerant to both software and hardware errors</li>
			<li>scale with the number of machines on the network</li>
			<li>be upgradable and reconfugurable without having to stop and restart</li>
			<li>be responsive to users within certain strict timeframes</li>    
			<li>stay in continuous operation for many years</li>
		  </ul>		  
		  <p>Because Erlang is oriented around concurrency, it's also naturally good at utilizing modern multicore systems.</p>		
		  <p>Lightweight concurrency transparent distribution hot code replacement, and OTP are some of the specific features that make Erlang a joy to work with.</p> 
		  <h1>battle-proven</h1>
		  <p>Erlang has been successfully used in production systems for over 20 years (with reported uptimes of 9-nines - that's 31ms of downtime a year). It's been proven to work well in both large-scale industrial software development, and in small agile teams in startups.</p>		
		  <p><strong>Ericsson</strong> themselves have used Erlang extensively for many projects of varying sizes, both commercial and internal. The AXD301 ATM, one of Ericsson's flagship products, may be the largest Erlang project in existence at over 1.1 million lines of Erlang.</p>		  
		  <p>Erlang users in the <strong>telecoms</strong> industry: Motorola, Nokia, T-Mobile, BT. <strong>Large software companies and startups</strong>: Amazon, Yahoo!, Facebook, Last.fm, Klarna, Tail-F, Github, Heroku, Engine Yard, MochiMedia. <strong>Open source projects</strong>: Flussonic, ejabberd, CouchDb, Riak, Disco, RabbitMQ, Dynomite.</p>
		  <h1>saves time and money</h1>		  
		  <p>Erlang lets you deliver kick-ass software faster, on smaller budgets and with smaller teams, and reduce TLC and TCO.</p>		  
		  <p>This is made possible by a number of reasons:</p>		  
		  <ul>
			<li>The OTP libraries provide a complete set of easy-to-use components for building robust distributed applications, that have been used in hundreds of projects, and thouroughly tested and debugged over the last 10 years.</li>
			<li>A large number of high-quality open-source libraries is available for many other tasks, such as XML processing or interacting with database systems such as PostgreSQL. Interfacing with existing code in Java, C, Python or Ruby is straightforward too.</li>
			<li>Erlang code tends to be conscise and readable, which is made possible by the simplicity of the language and powerful abstraction mechanisms available.</li>
			<li>Erlang scales well to large and small teams, and makes both top-down and bottom-up approaches to building software natural.</li>
			<li>Erlang is easy to learn. An experienced programmer can start writing useful code after a couple of days of learning Erlang.</li>
			<li>Availability of high-quality tools such as documentation generators, testing frameworks, debuggers, graphical diagnostics tools, and IDEs.</li>
		  </ul>  
		  <h1>easy to learn</h1>		  
		  <p>Erlang has a simple and consistent core which makes it easy to pick up. Experienced programmers can start writing useful code after a couple of days with Erlang. There are no complicated concepts to understand or arcane theories to master. The syntax may look a little different if you're coming from Ruby, Python, or Java, but it doesn't take long to get used to.</p>		  
		  <p>In fact, making the language easy to pick up was one of the original design goals of the Erlang development team. Erlang is very pragmatic and has been made by working programmers, for working programmers.</p>	
		  <h1>lightweight concurrency</h1>		  
		  <p>Processes are very lightweight, with only about 500 bytes of overhead per-process. This means that millions of processes can be created, even on older computers.</p>		  
		  <p>Because Erlang's processes are completely independent of OS processes (and aren't managed by the OS scheduler), your programs will behave in exactly the same way regardless of whether they run on Linux, FreeBSD, Windows or any of the other systems that Erlang runs on.</p>		  
		  <p>Because of Erlang's great support for concurrency it becomes natural to model applications around multiple independent communicating agents, which is just how things are in the real world.</p>	
		  <h1>hot code replacement</h1>		  
		  <p>In a real-time control system we often don't want to stop the system in order to upgrade the code. In certain real-time control systems we may never be able to turn off the system to perform upgrades, and such systems have to be designed with dynamic code upgrades in mind. An example of such system is the X2000 satellite control system developed by NASA.</p>		  
		  <p>When you write your app in Erlang, you get dynamic code upgrade support <em>for free</em> when you use <a href="#otp">OTP</a>. The mechanism itself is very straightforward and easy to understand.</p>		  
		  <p>This can save hundreds of hours of time in development:</p>		  
		  <p>This is a common Erlang development workflow:</p>		  
		  <ol>
			<li>Start the app.</li>
			<li>Edit the code.</li>
			<li>Recompile. (one keystroke)</li>
			<li>That's it! There is no restart step. The app gets updated with the new code while it's running and tests get run automatically to ensure there are no regressions. This of course works great with TDD too.</li>
		  </ol>		
		  <h1>transparent distribution</h1>		
		<p>Erlang programs can be easily ported from a single computer to a network of computers. With the exception of timing all operations in the distributed system will work in exactly the same way as they worked in a single-node system.</p>

It features powerful programming abstractions in Java and Scala, a high-performance runtime, and automatic program optimization.
		<br /><br />
		Stratosphere has native support for iterations, incremental iterations, and programs consisting of large DAGs of operations.";s:8:"features";s:3558:"<h2>More Operators</h2>
			<p>
			Stratosphere extends the well-known MapReduce model with new operators. These operators represent many common data analysis tasks more naturally and efficiently. All operators will start working in memory and gracefully go out of core under memory pressure.
			</p>
			<h2>Advanced Data Flow Graphs</h2>
			<p>
			Stratosphere allows to model analysis programs as advanced data flow graphs. For many applications, this is a more natural fit than the constrained MapReduce interface (strictly Map followed by Reduce). Furthermore, data pipelining and in-memory data transfers increase performance by drastically reducing disk and network I/O.
			</p>
			<h2>Powerful Programming Interfaces</h2>
			<p>
			You can write data analysis programs for Stratosphere in Java or Scala. Both APIs provide a powerful yet easy-to-use abstraction to compose data analysis programs by applying customizable transformations such as map, filter, reduce, and join on data sets. Stratosphere's high-level APIs hide the complexities of parallel programming and efficient data processing from the user. Behind the scenes, the Stratosphere optimizer compiles such programs into efficient, parallel data flows which are executed on a cluster or a local machine. 
			</p>
			<h2>Support for Iterative Algorithms</h2>
			<p>
			Data Mining, Machine Learning and Graph processing algorithms often require to loop over the working data multiple times. Stratosphere supports iterative algorithms in its core. (The runtime allows for very fast iteration times and the optimizer deals with caching loop-invariant data.) The advanced incremental iterations support algorithms that focus on the "hot part" of the evolving solution and may converge even faster. 
			</p>
			<h2>High-Performance Execution Runtime</h2>
			<p>
			Stratosphere features its own high-performance, massively-parallel execution runtime which has been built from ground up leveraging processing techniques of parallel database systems. The engine supports low-latency processing concepts such as pipelined execution, in-memory processing, and push-based data shipping as well as sort- and hash-based processing algorithms which go gracefully out-of-core if main memory is not sufficient.  
			</p>
			<h2>Built-In Optimizer</h2>
			<p>
			Stratosphere comes with an optimizer that is independent of the actual programming interface. It chooses a fitting execution strategy depending on the inputs and operations. For example the "Join" operator will choose between partitioning and broadcasting the data, as well as between running a sort-merge-join or a hybrid hash join algorithm. 
			</p>			
			<h2>System Stack</h2>
			<p>
			Stratosphere seamlessly integrates into existing Hadoop setups and runs side-by-side with Hadoop's TaskTrackers and DataNodes. Stratosphere can read data from Hadoop sources, but comes with its own efficient runtime. Similar to Hadoop, Stratosphere scales by adding more machines to the cluster.
Stratosphere runs also on Hadoop 2.2 (YARN), so you do not need to change your infrastructure.
The Local execution mode allows to debug and analyze your application right from your favorite IDE, without having Stratosphere installed.

PHP allows developers to write extensions in C to add functionality to the PHP language. These can then be compiled into PHP or loaded dynamically at runtime. Extensions have been written to add support for the Windows API, process management on Unix-like operating systems, multibyte strings (Unicode), cURL, and several popular compression formats. Other features include integration with IRC, dynamic generation of images and Adobe Flash content, and even speech synthesis.
